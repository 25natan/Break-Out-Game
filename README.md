About this project:

Creator: Nathan Ytzhaki - Student in Hadassah Academic College Jerusalem.
This project was made as final project in my OOP-Developing course.
All the functionality in the game - espacialy the phisics movement calculations - was
made all-new without using any other library or phisics engine.

Compile, build & debug:

To build this game-project you must have SFML
library downloaded on your computer and located 
in the C directory because that is where the cmake directs the compiler to find it.
When you have it you can build it (cmake project building) and run/debug as you wish.
SFML can be downloded from: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
